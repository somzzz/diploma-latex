Dynamic linking and loading are some of the most obscure processes which happen when an executable is run. However, tracing them by means of debuggers is a complex task which is not suitable for inexperienced users. In order to facilitate understanding of dynamic linking and loading, I created an interactive inspection tool with a user-friendly graphical user interface. The \project\ tool offers support to view the relevant areas of the program memory by making use of the existing functionality of debuggers. It is an educational tool which helps Computer Science students and hobbyists gain a better understanding on the subject of dynamic linking and loading.
